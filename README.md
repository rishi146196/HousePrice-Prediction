# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices using multiple machine learning algorithms and compares their performance. It is an end-to-end machine learning project that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview

Predicting house prices is a common problem in machine learning. The goal of this project is to apply different machine learning algorithms to predict house prices and evaluate their effectiveness. The project covers all the key steps in a data science pipeline, from data cleaning to final predictions, using the most common and effective algorithms.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes visualizations and statistical summaries to uncover relationships in the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - XGBoost
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, R², and cross-validation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses techniques like GridSearchCV to fine-tune models and improve performance.
- **Prediction**: The final model can predict house prices based on a set of input features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to houses (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.). It can be found [here](insert_link_to_dataset).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook House_Price.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the following tasks:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Visualize the dataset
   - Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models
   - Tune hyperparameters and generate predictions

## Models Used

- **Linear Regression**: A simple, interpretable model that fits a linear relationship between the features and the target.
- **Decision Tree**: A tree-based model that splits the data into subsets to make predictions.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy by averaging multiple trees.
- **Gradient Boosting**: A boosting algorithm that builds models sequentially, each correcting the errors of its predecessor.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A model that separates data into classes with maximum margin.
- **XGBoost**: An efficient, high-performance boosting algorithm often used in data competitions.

## Results

The project evaluates the performance of each model based on metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R² (coefficient of determination). The goal is to identify the most accurate model for predicting house prices.

To run a Streamlit app, you need to follow a series of steps. Here’s a complete guide along with the commands you'll need:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Running a Streamlit App

#### 1. *Install Streamlit*

If you haven’t installed Streamlit yet, you can do so using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

bash
pip install streamlit


#### 2. *Create a Streamlit App*

1. Create a new Python file for your Streamlit app. You can name it something like app.py. Use a code editor to write your app. For example, you can create it in your terminal:

   bash
   touch app.py
   

2. Open app.py in your code editor and add your Streamlit code. Here’s a simple example:

   python
   import streamlit as st

   st.title("My First Streamlit App")
   st.write("Hello, world!")
   

#### 3. *Run the Streamlit App*

Navigate to the directory where your app.py file is located in your terminal and run the following command:

bash
streamlit run app.py


#### 4. *Access the App*

Once you run the command, Streamlit will start a local server and provide you with a URL (usually http://localhost:8501). Open this URL in your web browser to see your Streamlit app in action.

### Summary of Commands

1. *Install Streamlit:*
   bash
   pip install streamlit
   

2. *Create a Streamlit app file:*
   bash
   touch app.py
   

3. *Run the Streamlit app:*
   bash
   streamlit run app.py
   

### Stopping the App

To stop the Streamlit server, go back to the terminal where it’s running and press Ctrl + C.

### Additional Tips

- If you make changes to your app.py, the Streamlit app will automatically refresh in the browser.
- You can also run other Python scripts that are designed for Streamlit in the same way by replacing app.py with your script’s filename.
